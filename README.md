# EvSim

This project works with the EvInterface. It was made during some courses in Keio University.

The goal is to have a simulation of Ev (Electric vehicules) charging to Energy Generators.

## Infra

We have a TCP server for each Energy Generator running on a different port (as this simulation is intended to be run localy). The Client will connect to them to interact.
